nat.templatebrains 0.5
======================
* xform_brain can now find the best available path from one template to another
  automatically.
* this uses new functions bridging_graph, shortest_bridging_seq and
  allreg_dataframe
* xform_brain now has an imagedata argument (to set sensible defaults for
  handling of inverse registrations, which are very slow for image data)
* fix: mirror_brain passes on transform argument
* dev: now imports igraph
* dev: requires nat >=1.7.0

nat.templatebrains 0.4.1
========================
* fix handling of regName in templatebrain
* fix as.templatebrain.im3d (completely broken due to variable name error)
* better defaults in as.templatebrain.im3d / as.templatebrain.character
  (both name and short name will be take from file name)
* print.templatebrain now includes short name

nat.templatebrains 0.4
======================
* prepare for CRAN release
* fix export of is.templatebrain
* give mirror_brain explicit transform argument
* full examples in mirror_brain and xform_brain functions and
  templatebrain-meths.
* add FCWB.demo as data object that can be loaded
* dev: integrate with nat.flybrains build on travis

nat.templatebrains 0.3
======================
* add bridging_sequence function to return a bridging registrations sequence
  that may span more than 2 template brains.
* xform_brain can apply compound registrations in one streamxform call
  (but depends on nat >=1.5.9 and CMTK >= 3.2.2)
* add is.templatebrain and as.character.templatebrain utility functions.
* switch to single option regdirs for all paths
* no longer suggests nat.flybrains but includes basic tests with internal data.

nat.templatebrains 0.2
======================
* move all generic functionality from nat.flybrains (which is now a data only
  package).
* give xform_brain a via option
* add options for directories containing bridging and mirroring registrations
  nb these can accept multiple dirs, but registration names must be globally
  unique.
* suggest nat.flybrains for tests
* package docs and tests
